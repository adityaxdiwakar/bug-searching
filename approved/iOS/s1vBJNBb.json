  "steps_to_repro": "- Go to a server that you have admin rights on - Click on the 3 dots next to the server name - Dont click on any of the options - Click the home button to come out of the app - Go to your notifications and click on one of them so discord opens that server while the menu is still up - You can now access some basic info of any server, such as the member list, where it is hosted and the channel and category creation screen (Doesnt work though)"
