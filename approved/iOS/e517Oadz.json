  "short_description": "Sending an edited picture sends a very tiny thumbnail (120x90, usually, sometimes a blank jpg of 0 bytes) instead of the full sized picture (HEIF only)",
  "steps_to_repro": "- Make sure HEIF (High Efficiency) format is enabled in Camera => Formats. Using default Camera app with Live Photo on, default Photo mode. - Take a picture in the Camera app. - Go to Photos app and edit the picture you just took, seemingly any edit (cropping a bit, rotating, auto tune etc) works, then save the edit with Done. - Upload the just edited picture with Paperclip => Tap the picture in the recent list there. Browsing the picture in Camera Roll won't produce the issue."
