  "short_description": "When calling someone who is not in your friends list (such as a bot), the \"need to be friends with x\" popup appears, but the \"Connect to Voice\" menu appears behind it - popup should only appear on top of the DM channel.",
  "steps_to_repro": "- Find a user that is not in your friends list (such as a bot). - Call this user. - When the popup appears, press \"Okay\" - Let the magic happen and the \"Connect to Voice\" menu with voice settings should appear. - May require one or two attempts, appears everytime for myself. - This may be inconsistency across devices but is a valid bug as of right now."
