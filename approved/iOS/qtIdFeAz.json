Use the format of <@###########> and place the mention at the bottom of the channel topic on its own line. - There must be one blank line above the meetnion as well. The mention can not be on the line immediately following the text. - Try opening the users panel in that channel on iOS, or navigating to that server right after opening the Discord app. "
