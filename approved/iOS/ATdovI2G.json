  "steps_to_repro": "- Open Discord. - Leave Discord open in the background and spend some time on other apps. - Go back to Discord, server list and user list might be distorted, but the main issue is trying to open the user list, settings, or an embed pic freezes Discord for 10-30 seconds before responding again. Scrolling and messaging still works though. - Extra notes: This bug report was denied first, but I noticed it was only people on iOS 9 that couldn't repro. Today a user on reddit had the same issue, also with the new iPad Pro 10.5'' and iOS 10.3.2, which leads me to believe it's either the 2017 iPad Pros, or iOS 10.3.2."
