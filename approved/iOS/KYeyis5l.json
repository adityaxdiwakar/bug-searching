  "actual_result": "The application either crashes upon the first @ or severely slows down with multiple problems and then crashes when pressing to open the Server Settings dropdown in a guild. (I\u2019m sure there are a couple other ways of making it crash as a side effect to this bug).",
  "expected_result": "The mentions list should load fine when inputting @, as well as load the everyone suggestion fine instead of creating a grey box and crashing/lagging the app.",
  "short_description": "When typing @ or beginning to mention everyone/here in an empty server, the app will either crash or extremely glitch out forcing you to restart, or will crash in other places as a result.",
  "steps_to_repro": "- Create a brand new channel (do not post any messages in it). - Open the keyboard and type \"@\"; this should bring up an empty grey mention suggestion box that may result in the app crashing. - If it does not crash, continue typing a couple more characters next to the @ such as every, until the grey rectangle goes down to the regular everyone suggestion size. - The app should now begin to lag/slow down the key presses as you continue typing. - Swiping to the channel list/member list causes the channels or members to appear in an odd way and then constantly flash around for a second or two. - When receiving messages in a channel the message will jump around in a very unintended way, not seen before. - More of the side effects of this bug can be read in 7938 reported by Ghoul."
