  "steps_to_repro": "- Have Friends List open - Force close Discord- Put your phone on Airplane Mode (Poor connection will help, but airplane mode is strongly suggested).- Open it.- While it is loading (having Wumpus on friends list section), quickly swipe right to see the search bar.- As soon that you see the search bar, quickly click on it before Discord loads completely. May take a few tries on a fast connection, but can be more easily reproduced on a slow connection (15ms ping)"
