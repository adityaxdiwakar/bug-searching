  "steps_to_repro": "- Go to server settings - Click on \"roles\" - Make sure there are a few roles (around 7 or so would be ideal) - Click \"edit\" - Drag one of the roles either from low in the list to high in the list or vice versa - Press \"done\" - IMPORTANT NOTE!!! This does not happen EVERY time. Please attempt to reproduce multiple times before denying this report"
