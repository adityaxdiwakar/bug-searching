  "actual_result": "Discord's  is way bigger, around twice the size of the original, thus HEIC pictures easily overshoot the 8MB limit",
  "expected_result": "The  that's uploaded to Discord has a decent file size (like other apps that create a  from a HEIC picture)",
  "short_description": "HEIC to jpg encoding is very inefficient, uploaded jpg ends up being huge in size",
  "steps_to_repro": "- Make sure to have High Efficiency selected as Formats in Camera - Take a normal photo with the camera app - Upload said photo in Discord from camera roll - Download the uploaded picture from Discord (Open Original and then Save As in the CDN link) - Copy the original photo from phone to desktop via USB - Compare photo sizes"
