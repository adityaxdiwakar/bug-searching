  "steps_to_repro": "- Enable AssistiveTouch in your device's settings and put it in the bottom right corner. - Open Discord and start typing a chat message. The AssistiveTouch button slides up to make room for the keyboard, but this causes the \"Send\" button to be blocked. - Compare this behaviour to another app like Apple's Messages app where doing this does not block the \"Send\" button."
