  "steps_to_repro": "- Have Discord Nitro - Find an emoji ID (example: 414542501043765258) - Go to a different server. - Send a message there like so: `<:here_you_can_put_whatever_you_want:414542501043765258>` - Have a different member of that server report what they see when they hover over the emoji in chat. - Instead of the real emoji name, they will see `here_you_can_put_whatever_you_want`, and that can be text as long as you want. - **Note:** If the person hovering over the emoji shares the server that the emoji's on, they'll see the real name."
