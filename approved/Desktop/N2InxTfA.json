  "steps_to_repro": "- Use this: ```if (('`123')) {        ('1\u20e3')(r => {            ('2\u20e3')(r=> {                ('3\u20e3');            });        });    }``` - You will see that the emojis don't output correctly - Try to copy the 1 2 3 boxes and it will output correctly outside of the code blocks - If you copy from the code blocks above to VSC or Atom, it will show the text as it is, try Googling the 2 Emoji and paste it into Discord, VSC, and Atom, they will render it correctly, Discord cannot render the number emojis in code blocks but renders basically everything else - REMEMBER TO COPY AND REPLACE 2\u20e3 WITH 2\ufe0f\u20e3"
