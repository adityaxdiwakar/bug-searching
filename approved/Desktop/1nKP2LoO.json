  "steps_to_repro": "- Have a bot with a profile picture set - Have it send a few messages in the channel of your choice - Disconnect your bot and make sure it is completely offline - Go to the Discord developers dashboard, go to the Bot tab, and remove the profile picture of the bot account - Refresh your client to make sure the old profile picture would not stay cached - Open the channel where the bot sent the messages back in step 2. Notice the profile picture is gone - Now open the profile of the bot. Notice the profile picture is still there"
