  "short_description": "Audio Devices dont work in discord after waking computer from sleep if power plan is set to High Performance unless you disconnect from the server or reload. On other power plans (Power saver, or Balanced) when waking the computer it disconnects and reconnects you to the voice server, so it doesnt experience the issue",
  "steps_to_repro": "- Step 1 Change your windows Power Plan setting to ``High Performance``  - Step 2 Open Discord client and join a voice channel  - Step 3 Put your computer to sleep  - Step 4 Awake computer and try to speak or hear anyone in discord voice."
