  "steps_to_repro": "- Click and drag a server icon a tiny bit - It will jump up 5 or 6 slots momentarily for about 1 frame then return to its original location (Gif attached is low framerate and is hard to see it happening) - If you let go during the frame where it jumps up you will move the server icon up as far as it appears to jump (also in gif) - If it doesnt occur anymore try clicking onto another server and then back onto the server you are testing with "
