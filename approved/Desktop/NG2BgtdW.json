  "steps_to_repro": "- get into a video call with your best friend - make sure both of you have your videos/screenshare on - make sure to show both feeds (doubleclick on your partner's video) and click on the enlarge button - resize discord until the videos are shown below one another - as you resize vertically (do horizontal first, then vertical resize), the bottom bar (hover to show \"leave call etc\") will vanish - ! This behaviour happens automatically when on ~ 15.6 and split screen, as it has the required window size - click away and back into the dm and observe"
