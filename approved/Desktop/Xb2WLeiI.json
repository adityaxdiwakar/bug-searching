  "short_description": "After switching from another language to Japanese IMEI and using special characters in Japanese IMEI, a different font is used for the next character",
  "steps_to_repro": "- Switch from normal to IMEI input mode (while using japanese as your keyboard language) - type a special character (such as \u300c\u300d\uff5b\uff5d\uff10\uff11\uff12\uff13\uff14\uff15\uff16\uff17\uff18\uff19\uff0d\uff1d\uff01\uff20\uff03\uff04\uff05\uff3e\uff06\uff0a\uff08\uff09\uff3f\uff5c\uffe5\uff1f\uff1e\uff1c\uff0c\u3002\u30fb\uff5c) - type two letters in IMEI input that can be converted to hiragana (such as 'su', which gets converted to \u3059), the first character and the first subsequent hiragana character will use a a different font (just like the different font for the above alphanumeric characters) (example: \uff19\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093 vs the expected 9\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093)- upon further review, this can also be done by typing the hiragana character first and then writing the special character before it (which suggests to me that it has something to do with how fonts are applied during the input of the special characters)"
