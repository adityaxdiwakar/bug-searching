  "steps_to_repro": "- Start listening on Spotify - Send a Spotify Embed in a channel - Get someone to listen along - Start playing a game so the Spotify rich presences goes off your profile - The other person should still be listen along - Try skipping a song on shuffle or change to a different playlist or something - The other person should still be \"attached\" so they are still listening with you - Check the embed again and in the corner where you change to online/Idle/DnD etc, and see that the other person's profile picture isn't there and yet they are still listening along/"
