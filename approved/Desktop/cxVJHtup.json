  "steps_to_repro": "- Have a slow internet connection, or send way too many messages, so you've got enough time until they send (like spam \"a\" over and over, which is what I did in this case) - Right click it before it gets fully white, and sends - Try and use a feature other than Copy ID while it's still pending, the right click menu will close once it's fully sent - Observe that while you can still use them, they still don't apply (for instance, adding an reaction will only add it for less than a second, or editing & attempting to delete via editing won't edit it or delete it)"
