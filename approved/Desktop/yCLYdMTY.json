  "steps_to_repro": "- First make sure to have the taskbar set to automatically hide by right-clicking on the bar and going into its settings. - Maximise Discord. If you use multiple monitors, make sure to maximise Discord to the first (main); since on my end it doesn't work on my end when I do this to my second monitor - Try to use the taskbar by moving to the bottom most point of the screen. - A GIF to prove: <http://i.imgur.com/oSQDvud.gifv>"
