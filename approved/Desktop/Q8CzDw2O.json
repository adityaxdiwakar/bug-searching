  "steps_to_repro": "- Go to a server with a lot of users (Like Discord Testers) - Start scrolling the right side user list really fast (I use a infinite scroll wheel function on my mouse), you know you're going fast enough if the users aren't rendering. - Do this for like 15 - 20 seconds and then stop scrolling - When you're done scrolling and it stopped, hover over a user and don't move your mouse. - When hovering you see that the hover effect disappears after 1 second, what isn't normal."
