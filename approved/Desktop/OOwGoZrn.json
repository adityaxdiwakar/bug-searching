Windows + Shift + S for something quick. - Get to a channel where you can spam without getting punished for it and you can post images at. - Spam paste the image, Ctrl + V and then enter until an error pops up. (Don't hit enter when the error pops up or else it will pop up again and you may not be able to recreate the error!) - When the error pops up, *quickly* click on \"Click here to retry the upload\" button. Please mind you may fail to recreate the bug on the first try, try more than once!"
