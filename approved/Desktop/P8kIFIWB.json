  "steps_to_repro": "- First, go into any Discord server. - Find any player in the player list on the right. - Left click their name in the server so you get their player card. - Scroll over to their username, and highlight the whole username (name and #) by left clicking it twice with your mouse. - Once highlighted, press \"Command\" and \"C\" to copy the highlighted text. - Once copied, go into the chat bar and press \"Command\" and \"V\" to paste it. - You'll see that instead of only copying the user's username, you copied everything that was present in the user's card, i.e. their roles, what game they were playing."
