  "short_description": "[most likely macOS specific] Discord crashes when joining a call, reloading the client and then interacting with the properties of the \u201cTop Secret Control Panel\u201d in the menu bar.",
  "steps_to_repro": "- Make sure the control panel icon is visible in the menu bar at the top of your screen. - Join a voice channel or call. - Without leaving the call press CMD/Ctrl + R - Discord should/will now reload and the application will reappear within a couple seconds. - When the discord logo starts to spin, click on the \u201cTop Secret Control Panel\u201d dropdown icon. - Quickly press \u201cMute\u201d & \u201cDeafen\u201d a couple times before Discord finishes reloading. - Discord should now abort the reload and crash. - This may require a couple of attempts as the interaction with the Control Panel (CP) fails sometimes."
