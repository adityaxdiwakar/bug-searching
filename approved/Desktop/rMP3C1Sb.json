  "short_description": "issues with mic input showing as always broadcasting, even if no audio is picked up - for client and other users in voice",
  "steps_to_repro": "- Use any kind of input for voice that doesn't actually broadcast audio (or has some kind of hardware mute) - Insure that mic input sensitivity is manually set to -100dB - The bubble in voice should appear illuminated.  Note that having a sensitivty of -99dB will work as expected."
