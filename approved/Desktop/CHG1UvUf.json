  "steps_to_repro": "- Create a GIF with 40 ms frames. - Make the last frame 2000 ms. - Create same GIF but make the last frame 40 ms and repeat it 50 times instead. Ensure that the program doesn't optimise it to a single 2000 ms frame! With Screen To Gif (free tool) you can do this by unchecking \"Detect unchanged pixels\" when saving. - Upload both gifs in a Discord chat. Or upload on imgur or Gfycat and post a link. I think imgur has the same problem, but Gfycat doesn't. - In the first GIF the last frame is played as fast as the other frames. The second GIF plays as intended though."
