  "steps_to_repro": "- Enter a text channel where you have link embed permissions. - Send one message containing URLs to two videos which are both handled by Discord's native player (e.g., Streamable; for ease of replication, use paths \"/l7bid\" and \"/bydom\") - Once sent, both videos are embedded below the message. - Play the first video. - While the first video is playing, edit your message, adding lt and gt symbols (\"<\" and \">\") around the first URL. Press enter to confirm the edit."
