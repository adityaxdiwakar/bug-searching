  "short_description": "When you DM someone with a lot of roles from a server and he play a song on Spotify, the UI interface messes up.",
  "steps_to_repro": "- Create a server - Create some roles (around 6/7) with long names - Invite a friend and give him all of those roles - Open DM menu (Left click on his profile and Start writing a DM without leaving the server nor sending it) - Make him play a song on Spotify (For the bug to work, he need to play a song AFTER you open the menu and write a DM, the game detection need to be empty before opening the menu)"
