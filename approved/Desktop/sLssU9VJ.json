  "actual_result": "There is no visible scroll handle, or, at certain client heights (1300px), there is a 1px tall scroll handle. Clicking in the scrollbar causes the client to scroll as normal, however, outside of wearing out your mouse wheel, there is no way to quickly rescroll to the very top of the list. The 1px tall scroll handle isn't suitable compared to the ~25px tall scroll handle in chrome",
  "expected_result": "There is an (albeit) small scroll handle, that you can click and drag to quickly scroll through the list, or return to the top. (Verified working on Chrome 66)",
