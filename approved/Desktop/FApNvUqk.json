  "steps_to_repro": "- Copy the link to a message in a channel & post it into the text field - Change the message ID at the end of the link to \"0\" - Post it and click on it (Try this a few times in different channels if it doesn't work the first time) - Additionally, after having followed the steps, if the link is still visible after jumping and messages were seen to disappear (this occurs mostly if the channel hasn't received any new messages for a week or so), then you can delete the message link to have the effect be permanent"
