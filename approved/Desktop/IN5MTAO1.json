  "steps_to_repro": "- click on the search bar and start a search - type (von:) which means from to filter by user - select a random user then start a search for it to save in history - go to language settings and change the language back to English - open the search bar and observe - (this can be done with other filters/languages if the older language contains filters from the new one just like \"von\" contains \"on\")"
