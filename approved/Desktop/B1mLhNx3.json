  "steps_to_repro": "- This bug technically affects all clients since it's about missing string exports on Crowdin, but the bug is only observable on Android because of https://trello. com/c/2BskgKam/ - Make sure you're using a language different than English - Find an invalid channel mention. Notice it's translated - Find an invalid user mention. Notice it isn't translated - You can also go to Crowdin and notice that `invalid-channel` is present but not `invalid-user`"
