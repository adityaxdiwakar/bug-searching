Your frequently used emojis will still be available in emoji picker, which is normal because they are still cached in your session memory. They will effectively be gone next time client is restarted... unless you follow next steps  - Open your emoji picker in any chat and just use 1 random emote - Trigger the local data persister, which is done by pressing Home button, waiting a few seconds and reopening Discord - Now you can restart Discord using force-close"
