  "steps_to_repro": "- First, **kill** Discord completely from Recent Tasks (this may be an important step) - Open Discord, and be viewing a random channel. - Take note of your current screen orientation. Example: **Portrait** - Minimize Discord using the Home button - Open another random app on your device - Change your screen orientation to **the opposite** of the one noted at step 3. In my case, **Landscape** - Have someone mention you in a channel, different than the one you were viewing at step 2. This is to trigger a push notification. - **While keeping the screen orientation of step 6**, open the push notification"
