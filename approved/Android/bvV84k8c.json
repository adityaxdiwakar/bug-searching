Tap the magnifying glass and search for anything - In the search results, pick any message and jump to it - Go back to the channel you were typing the message in - Finish typing your message and send it - Now, minimize Discord using the Home button of your phone - Re-open Discord using the shortcut icon on your homescreen (NOT VIA MULTI-TASKING) - Look at the textfield"
