  "short_description": "Hard crashing of discord upon skipping songs on Spotify ( might take a few tries and lot of patience to reproduce)",
  "steps_to_repro": "- Have a Spotify account connected to discord  - Play a song on Spotify and wait for discord to detect it  - Play 3 to 4 songs without skipping  - Pause the song and go to another app (preferably YouTube) make sure you don't swipe discord or  Spotify away from recent apps - Use the other app for sometime  (untill your OS automatically closes discord due to inactivity, might take upto half an hour - Now go to Spotify and search a new song and play it  - Go back to discord via recent apps"
