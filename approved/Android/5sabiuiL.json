  "steps_to_repro": "- Have someone send a message containing a mention in the first line, followed by a 1 or 2 lines of codeblock. Notice the presence of the background on the codeblock in the in-app notification (see screenshot 1) - Receive another in-app notification, this time with a message containing a multiline codeblock that is 4+ lines tall (I couldn't repro with 3 lines but could with 4 or 5). To be sure to reproduce, I suggest putting like 10 lines of code."
