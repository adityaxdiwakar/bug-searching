You can uncollapse other categories to make the list longer. - Collapse the top category. - Scroll to the very bottom of the channels list. - Scroll back up quickly and look at the arrow next to the top category. You are able to catch it rotating sometimes. - For this example I used DTesters by collapsing the information category. Depending on your roles, you may be seeing more or less channels than I am."
