  "expected_result": "In this case once a user deselects \"Sync Across Clients\" the language should reset to original.",

  "steps_to_repro": "- Open \"User Settings\" - Go to \"Language\" - Enable \"Sync Across Clients\" - Select a language different from English. (On both phone and desktop it should update) - Deselect \"Sync Across Clients\" (Go check Desktop it should stay as the synced language even after restarting)"
