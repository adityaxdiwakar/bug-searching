  "steps_to_repro": "- Go to voice settings, switch on \"push to talk\" and keep yourself muted already (which can be done by joining any vc and muting your mic) - Video Call someone (they need not to pickup the call) - Notice your video opens as soon as you video call someone with buttons at the bottom (toggle video, disconnect and mute/unmute) which fade away after like 3 seconds. - Click on video button to close your video and see the buttons reappears. - Now click again and open your video, and click on close video button JUST BEFORE the buttons at the bottom fades away (like at 2.9th second)"
