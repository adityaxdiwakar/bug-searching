Server (which you have ownership) , go to server settings scroll the bottom and see the blanket is too short below of bans setting - Now go to the 2. Server which you have admin perms but not owned. Scroll to the bottom and observe below of thr bans settings - Compare it, the 2. Server will have very long bottom - That is caused by the ' Security ' settings in the up. If theres a security settings the bottom would be short"
