  "steps_to_repro": "- Post a few invite links in chat. Works with only one, but effect is more noticeable when there are several invite embeds - Scroll to a point in chat where many invite embeds are visible - Rotate screen. You may need to do it repeatedly to notice it. Also you can disable transition animations in your Android developer options, it may help"
