Don't switch to it yet.  - Have someone (I'll call him \"the Shitposter\") post a few messages made of 2000 period characters \".\" (using any platform) - Let the chat going on normally so that the messages of the Shitposter go off screen - Now you can switch to that channel, and try to scroll up through the chat history"
