Switch to another one in the same server.  - Wait for new unread messages on the channel you picked at step 1 - Switch back to this channel. If you can see the \"New Messages\" red bar without having to scroll up, you're good to go. You must NOT touch your screen after switching back to channel. - Wait for the \"New messages\" bar to reach the top of the screen"
