  "steps_to_repro": "- Close all other instances of discord to ensure mobile push notifications are sent - Ensure Discord is not running in the background by closing it via the app switcher - Open the app, type a message in the message box but don't send it - Close the app, but ensure it's still running in the background (Home Button, App Switcher, etc.) - Receive a push notification in the same channel you originally had a draft in - Open the push notification - If the draft isn't immediately replaced, the draft gets saved somewhere - Type another (different) message in the box but again, don't send it - Close out of the app again, ensuring it is running in the background - Receive and open another push notification in the same channel as before - Observe the message has been replaced - Note: This doesn't appear to be 100% consistent in presenting itself. If the draft doesn't get replaced, repeat steps 7 to 11. It should present itself within a few tries - See attached YouTube video for a demonstration"
