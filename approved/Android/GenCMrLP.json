Click on change password and notice the toast saying \"must be between 1 and 128 in length\" - Now go back, click on change password again, and enter a password in current password (not long, for example type sjsjdkdkd) and in new password type a single letter (for example \"a\"), click on change password and notice the toast saying \"password must be 6-128 characters long\""
