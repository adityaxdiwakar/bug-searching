  "steps_to_repro": "- Connect to any voice channel on Android, - Accept an ongoing phone call/make a phone call, - People in the voice channel can hear all you say and hear through you, - Also Discord's voice channel sound management is treated as a \"call\" type rather than \"media\" so it's minimum possible voice is still too high and requires one to lower every person's voice level around to 30% one by one; this \"call\" type treatment is probably the reason Discord doesn't get suppressed by the phone call and interferes it."
