  "steps_to_repro": "- Open Discord - Go to a channel with no particular activity - Quit Discord - Have someone mention you in a channel different that the one you picked at step 2. You should have received a push notification with ability to reply -  Now re-open Discord via multi-tasking or via the homescreen icon, ensure that you don't dismiss the push notification - Pull down your notification drawer and hit Reply - In the textfield, enter an invalid message. For example, input a Space character and send the message - You will see a \"Failed to send mesage\" alert. Just ignore it, collapse your notification drawer and get back at chatting on Discord - After a few seconds, Discord crashes"
