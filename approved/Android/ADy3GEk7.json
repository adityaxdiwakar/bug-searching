  "steps_to_repro": "- Have two servers A and B with a lot of channels. There is one requirement: the server A mustn't have any uncategorized channels. It is easier to repro in Landscape mode as there is less channels in sight. - In the server A, have all channels marked as read except the second one in the list (might work for first channel but inconsistent for me). It is important that no unread channel is present at the bottom - Switch to server B - Scroll all the way down in the channel list - Switch to server A. You should see the New Unreads button at the top (appearing for no reason but whatever) - Tap on it"
