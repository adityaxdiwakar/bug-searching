  "actual_result": "It won't update in the current server you're in, but if you switch to a different server and open member list, the correct status will show. I fail to reproduce this issue sometimes, make sure to give it a few tries (success rate is around 75% for me)",

  "steps_to_repro": "- Go to any server, preferably one where you are high placed in member list - Close Discord completely by removing it from recent apps and reopen - Open member list of the server (just to check your current status) and close it - Now switch your presence to a different status (idle, dnd, etc) - Reopen member list of same server"
