  "steps_to_repro": "- Use Discord v3.3.3 on Android 6.0 mobile device - In Discord environment, open any text channel on any server that has at least 1 server-specific emoji uploaded - Manually type or paste text code for a server-specific emoji (beginning and ending with colon, e.g. \\:bugbutton\\: on Discord Testers) and then push enter after inputting only one server-specific emoji - Now repeat previous step but type the emoji code two times consectively without any spaces in between each emoji code "
