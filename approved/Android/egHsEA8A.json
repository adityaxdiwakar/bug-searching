  "steps_to_repro": "- For example, let's simulate a case. Let's say you and MR.1 are admins in a server. Both of you join a voice channel with some people to talk about cats. And, then MR.1 wants to make a joke and server mute yourself. - In the mobile app you are not able to unmute or undeafen yourself. You need someone else to do it. Someone have to unmute yourself exactly how you was muted. - It is really weird, if you are the owner and your staff want to make jokes like this, and you cannot unmute yourself"
