Ask the owner to create a category with one voice channel in it that you have permission to see. - Then collapse that category so the voice channel is hidden. - Now ask the owner to take away your permission to see the voice channel. The category doesn't disappear (but does on Desktop). - You can even close and relaunch the app. The category is still visible. It only disappears once you try to uncollapse it."
