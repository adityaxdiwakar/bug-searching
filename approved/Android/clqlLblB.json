This is the best way to simulate a weak connection.  - Open Server Settings > Channels - Select either text or voice sorting mode (personally it occured more often when sorting voice channels, but that might be just me)  - Try to sort several channels successively by moving them into different categories. Try to be as quick as possible (without making it a destructive behavior either) : move another channel as soon as you released your finger to move a channel"
