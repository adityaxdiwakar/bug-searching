  "steps_to_repro": "- Open Discord and toggle split screen mode. - Resize Discord so that it occupies 1/3rd (minimum) size of the screen and tap on it to focus the Discord app. - Slide from left to right, to open side panel and click on quick switcher icon at the bottom. - Notice the keyboard pops up, close it using navigation back button on your device. - Now at the end, resize Discord to 1/2 screen size (occupying half of the screen) while the quick switcher is open and keyboard closed. - Retry from step one if you don't get it at the first time."
