Make sure that the channels are ordered as the following in the dropdown: `a, b, c, d, e, f` - On Desktop, move the category 2 above the category 1 - Repeat step 2 on Android, the order should be now: `d, e, f, a, b, c` - On Desktop, revert the category order as it was before step 3 - On Android, go to Server Settings > Channels, enter Category sort mode and move Category 2 above Category 1 again - Return to Create Instant Invite and now observe the order"
