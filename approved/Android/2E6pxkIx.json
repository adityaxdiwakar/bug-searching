  "actual_result": "Nothing will happen on your Android app, you have to restart the app to see the unread white dot back on the channel.

  "steps_to_repro": "- Have someone post a few messages in any channel, including one that contains a @ mention towards you (user tag or role mention, no matter)  - On Desktop, read those messages, and then make sure that the channel is correctly marked as read on Android as well - Switch to another channel on Android, bug stay in the same server - While keeping your Android app open, mark the messages as Unread on Desktop by doing Alt+Click on an old message"
