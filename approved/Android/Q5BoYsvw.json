  "steps_to_repro": "- Have light theme enabled first (for immediate result) - install 713 - open Discord and notice that the \"friends\" tab doesn't say friends or have any visible buttons - if you swap to light theme, close Discord and leave it for 5 minutes or so you'll get the same result. Switching channels seems to fix this bug"
