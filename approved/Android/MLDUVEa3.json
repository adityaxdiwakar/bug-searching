  "steps_to_repro": "- Force close and open Discord app and toggle split-screen. - Keep it in half of your screen and click on quick switcher icon at the bottom after focusing on the Discord app screen. - Notice the keyboard pops up, leave it as it is and click on any last channel you visited that's shown there as soon as the quick switcher opens up. - Notice that new Discord app launches in the bottom half of the screen, the upper half reloads and quickly opens up in full screen. - Click on recent app to view list and notice there are two Discord windows which you can access simultaneously using split screen (although both respond exactly the same) - Force close and again start from step one if can't able to reproduce it in the first attempt."
