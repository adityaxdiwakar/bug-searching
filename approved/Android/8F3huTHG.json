You can test with much more than 4 servers, it may increase your success rate - Boot up the app - Switch to server A - Open your emoji picker to ensure emojis from server A are correctly loaded - Do the same for servers B and C  - Now switch to server D - Leave the server D - Return to servers A, B and C and check the emoji picker for each of them - If you cannot reproduce, try again after clearing your app data or uninstall/reinstall Discord and login back. The cache may cause inconsistencies."
