  "steps_to_repro": "- Go to Add a Friend screen - Write something then add extra spaces (e.g `\"xxx          \"` without quotes) - Tap on Enter key on your keyboard. Make sure you're using SwiftKey keyboard (it's the default one installed on Huawei devices, also downloadable from Play store). I was unable to reproduce with GBoard - Repeat step above a few times"
