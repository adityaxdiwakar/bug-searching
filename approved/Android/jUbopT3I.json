If you don't have a device without flash, you can try to set up an android emulator using Bluestacks or similar programs. (I tested with bluestacks first) - Open up discord, and find a server where you can attach files. - Open up the \"Add content\" menu using the plus button next to the chat. - Try to attach a file using the paper icon. - Now the \"Flash off\" message comes up, despite you not clicked on the camera icon."
