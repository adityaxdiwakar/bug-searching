  "steps_to_repro": "- Go to Audit Logs - Tap Filter by actions or user - Tap the textfield. Notice how the panel extends to fullscreen when keyboard opens - Type nonsense stuff in the search bar so it gives no results (or write something that gives only 2 or 3 results, works as well) - Close the keyboard - Attempt to make the panel fullscreen again (swipe up, reopen keyboard, etc)"
