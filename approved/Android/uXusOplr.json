Note the number of members it shows that would be pruned who are inactive for 1 day.  - Rotate your device to switch to landscape mode. Notice the number of members are not the same. - Come back to portrait mode, still number of members are not accurate unless you click on the first tab (1 day) and manually refresh the tab."
